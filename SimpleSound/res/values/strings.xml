        Once upon a time you dressed so fine\n
		You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn\'t you ?\n
		People\'d call, say, "Beware doll, you\'re bound to fall"\n
		You thought they were all kiddin\' you\n
		You used to laugh about\n
		Everybody that was hangin\' out\n
		Now you don\'t talk so loud\n
		Now you don\'t seem so proud\n
		About having to be scrounging for your next meal.\n
		\n
		How does it feel\n
		How does it feel\n
		To be without a home\n
		Like a complete unknown\n
		Like a rolling stone ?\n
