	<string name="turing_text">Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. 
He was highly influential in the development of computer science, giving a formalisation of the 
concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, which can be considered a
 model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of 
 computer science and artificial intelligence.
 Since 1966, the Turing Award has been given annually by the Association for Computing 
 Machinery for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community. 
 It is widely considered to be the computing world\'s highest honour, equivalent to the 
 Nobel Prize.</string>

	    Richard Manning Karp (born January 3, 1935) is an American computer scientist and 
	    computational theorist at the University of California, Berkeley, notable for 
	    research in the theory of algorithms, for which he received a Turing Award in 1985,
	    The Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science in 2004, and the Kyoto 
	    Prize in 2008.
	    His citation for the Turing Award was as follows:
		\'For his continuing contributions to the theory of algorithms including 
		the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial 
		optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with 
		the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions 
		to the theory of NP-completeness. Karp introduced the now standard methodology 
		for proving problems to be NP-complete which has led to the identification of 
		many theoretical and practical problems as being computationally difficult.\'
